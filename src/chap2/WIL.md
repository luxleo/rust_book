Summary

    This project was a hands-on way to introduce 
    you to many new Rust concepts: let, match, functions,
    the use of external crates, and more. In the next few chapters,
    you’ll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3 
    covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, 
    data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. 
    Chapter 4 explores ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other 
    languages. Chapter 5 discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 
    explains how enums work.
