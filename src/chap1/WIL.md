# 1.3 Hello cargo
[reference](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html)

## recap
- We can create a project using `cargo new`.
- We can build a project using `cargo build`.
- We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
- We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
- Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.

## summary
You’re already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, you’ve learned how to:

- Install the latest stable version of Rust using `rustup`
- Update to a newer Rust version
- Open locally installed documentation
- Write and run a “Hello, world!” program using rustc directly
- Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo
